# SILS

SILS (Statistical Investigation of Language Structures) is my attempt to apply statistical and machine learning methods to the [WALS dataset](https://wals.info/). WALS compiles features of the world's languages from various published grammars, showing how languages vary and the common patterns found across many different languages.

I'm doing this work as my final project for [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/).
